# Forest Fire VR

This project showcases an implementation of the "Game Of Life" logic to a VR enviroment. The application is a randomised event of a forest fire, with additional features added to enhance the experience when inside VR.

## Features:

### :deciduous_tree: Tree Felling
Use the enhanced minimap to track down the abandoned fire axe (Someones probably left one in a tree somewhere!). With the fire axe wielded, 3 swings is all it takes to fell any living tree in the forest. Use this to clear a safe area and stop fire spread.

### :heart: Player Health & Damage System 
Your player has a convenient health bar located on the right wrist, keep an eye on this as you navigate the forest fire. Standing too close to a fire for too long will inflict permanent damage.
<br><br>

### :mag: Enhanced Minimap
In your left hand you will notice a sprite based minimap. Use your right hand to aim the green ray at the slider below the map and grab using trigger, to change the zoom level and your vision. The map will alert you to any fire spread, burnt trees and the inital axe spawn location.
